# sifter-ruby

It's an API wrapper for the [Sifter API](http://sifterapp.com/developer). You
can use it to fetch projects, issues, milestones, and people from your Sifter
accounts.

## Installation

    gem install sifter
    
## Getting started

First you'll need to generate a Sifter API token. You can do this in your
Sifter account by going to "My Profile", clicking "Access Keys" and filling out
form. Once you've got that, you create an account object like so:

    hostname = "example.sifterapp.com"
    token = "abc123"
    account = Sifter::Account.new(hostname, token)

All of the functionality in the Sifter API hangs off `Sifter::Account`. You can
fetch projects, issues, and milestones like so:

    projects = account.projects 
    issues = projects.first.issues
    milestones = projects.first.milestones

You can now also fetch comments and attachemnts from issues.

    comments = projects.first.issues.first.comments
    attachments = projects.first.issues.first.comments.first.attachment_objs
